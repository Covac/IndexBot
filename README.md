# About project

First there were only CLI commands, now there is entire web-ui that I won't provide (at least for now)
Before I continue about design philosophy I have to say, please use this in moderation or at least try,
This goes specificaly to (I just saw and it is the reason for writing this) 2 unique cloners that I am pretty sure, TODAY
Botted at least whole Iran-Israel comment section, in most obvious way possible, Technocracy is not for id**ts. This is why some stuff is closed source...

## Design philosophy

I wasn't sure if there was gonna be a need for IP ban evading, so there is a bunch of anonimity options built in, SOCKS5(for example).
Target hardware was cheap web service or old laptop, so there was no plans to go design it in a way that would scale easily

## TBC ...

*Please use this for fun, don't abuse it.*

## Well it's over now anyway

I didn't update this because of potential for abuse but everything falls apart with this, so don't bother trying unless you have easy access to gmail accounts, and hook them up with google API to read emails.
Time to archive 😢
