# About project

First there were only CLI commands, now there is entire web-ui that I won't provide (at least for now)
Before I continue about design philosophy I have to say, please use this in moderation or at least try,
This goes specificaly to (I just saw and it is the reason for writing this) 2 unique cloners that I am pretty sure, TODAY
Botted at least whole Iran-Israel comment section, in most obvious way possible, Technocracy is not for id**ts. This is why some stuff is closed source...

## Design philosophy

I wasn't sure if there was gonna be a need for IP ban evading, so there is a bunch of anonimity options built in, SOCKS5(for example).
Target hardware was cheap web service or old laptop, so there was no plans to go design it in a way that would scale easily

## TBC ...

*Please use this for fun, don't abuse it.*
