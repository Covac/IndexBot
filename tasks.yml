# -------- TASK: SHITPOST --------
# Posts predefined or AI-generated comments to a specified feed or URL.
#
# **Supports multiple user accounts in a single task.**
#
# Parameters:
# - task: Required. The type of task, in this case "SHITPOST".
# - user: Required. **One or more email addresses** for users posting the comments.

# - feed: Required. The RSS feed or URL to monitor for content.
# - comments: Optional. A list of predefined comments to post. **DO NOT use lists if doing `ai_generated: true`.**
# - ai_generated: Optional. **If true, comments will be generated by AI** based on the provided instructions. 
#     - ! If `ai_generated: true`, the `comments` are instructions that are executed on article content.
#     - Ensure you provide clear instructions for the AI-generated comments. There can and will be badly generated responses, be wary.
# - timeout: Required. Delay in seconds between each comment post.
# - use_shared_history: Optional. If true, comments history will be shared across tasks with this option enabled. Effect is that only one user can comment on an article. One without it will ignore this restriciton

# - end_time_utc: Optional. End time of the task in UTC (format: "HH:MM:SS").

# -------- RSS FEEDS --------
# Some SHITPOST tasks support automatic monitoring of RSS feeds for new content.
#
# Parameters:
# - use_rss_feed: If true, the task monitors RSS feeds for new posts.
# - feed: Required. URL of the RSS feed to monitor. You can find feeds here "https://www.index.hr/rss/info"
# - Example feeds:
#   - https://www.index.hr/rss/vijesti-svijet

#   - https://www.index.hr/rss/magazin
# --------------------------------------------

# Example:
# - task: SHITPOST
#   user: [user3@example.com, user4@example.com]
#   use_rss_feed: true
#   feed: https://www.index.hr/rss
#   ai_generated: true
#   comments: Napiši komentar na hrvatskom jeziku. Komentar nesmije biti dulji od 1 rečenice. Budi sarkastičan. Pazi na pravopis. Ti si muško.
#   timeout: 5555
#   use_shared_history: true
#   low_profile: false
#   start_time_utc: "09:25:00"
#   end_time_utc: "23:25:00"

# -------- ADDITIONAL NOTES --------
# - Tasks are designed to perform specific actions based on the type and parameters.
# - Timeout values are important to avoid rate-limiting or detection by the system. There are still hardcoded timeouts based on 'New Used' data.
# - SHITPOST tasks can support multiple accounts, and `ai_generated` will override manual comments.
# - User profiles and email addresses should be unique per task for consistency.
# - For tasks running over extended periods, ensure the start and end times align with system capabilities.
# - There is no history logging so tasks will forget what they commented on if program restarts. It will fill itself back but only after failing because they already commented. Which is not an issue.
#
# Suggested features (in development):
# - `spoof_beacons`: Consider testing the usefulness of spoofing interaction beacons.
